# Battery-Voltage-Indicator
The goal of this project was to obtain the voltages of two 12 volt batteries. 
Written in C on a PIC16f690, the user pushes a button in order to display each voltage on
a 16x2 LCD display. The code is configured to interface with the LCD
using 8 bits, 4 "high" bits, or 4 "low" bits, depending on what pins
you'd like open for use.
